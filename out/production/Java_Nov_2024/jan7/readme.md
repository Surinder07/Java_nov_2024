## Inheritance 



## Polymorphism 

when a specific thing behave differently in diff situation 


                     Shape

      Rectangle     Circle      Polyon  Square
  calcualte area() ----> 

1. Method Overloading  - Compile time polymorphism  
2. Method overriding   - Runtime Polymorphim 

Upcasting 

parent class reference can be assigned to child class object


                        Car [brand, model, price] - printDetails()
                |           |                   |
    GasolineCar        Diesel Car           Electic Car 


 create object of Gasoline car    , Diesel Car, Electic Car 
but all them should have a reference to Car class 


Car gasoline = new Gasoline();
Car electric = new ElecticCar();
Car electric = new DieselCar();













Packages 
1. User defined package - which is created by programmer
2. Inbuilt packages - which is already create by Java 



util, io, lang, net, sql ...
