## Recap 

inheritance 

Polymorphism
compile time polymorphism 

runtime polymorphism - method overriding 




what is meant by compilation ? 


Test.java ------> 
javac Test.java 
----> .class 



## static 

1. variable 
2. method  - 


when you make a method as static 
we dont need to create an object to call that method. 
That method belongs to class 


3. class  -- we will talk about this during nested class 
4. block  


static int x = 10; // shareable property of class 

## final 

variable  - its becomes constant
method  - you can not override that method 
class  - you can not inherit from that class 

## this 

it refers to current object 


## super

has to be the first in the constructor body 





## Encapsulation
