## Recap 

Encapsulation - getter/setter

static - static method ? 
final 
this 
super 


static block 
instance 

run the class 


this and super 


Test(int a){

this();
super();

}


final 

variable   
method  
class 

class A {



}

class B extends A {



}





Has - A relationship 

IS-A relationship ? 


Aggregation 


Employee has a address 
Employee is a address  X


Student has Course

Maven 
Lombok 





## Abstraction

showing only the essential features and hiding the complex details 

Java 7 

1. abstraction class  [0-100 %] 
2. interfaces  [100 % ]



// how to make a class a abstract class ?
// abstract -


    // an abstract can have abstract or non abstract methods
    // abstract methods does not have body or implementation

    // if a class has an abstract method, class must be abstract



    // concrete method
//  public abstract void show();


// You can not create an object of abstract class 
can not instantiate abstract class 






read about : Interview question
Singleton class and check the implementation of that class

contructor can be private 




## Interfaces 


what is interface ? 
- template 
- -similar to the class 
- it has constants 
- all methods are abstract 
- 100 % of abstraction 
- multiple inheritance 


its a contract which every class have to fulfill , whoever is going to 
inherit from it . 



How to declare interace? 

interface Test {

// all the variables/fields are by default 
public static final 


// all the methods are by default 
public and abstract

you can not create object of interface





}
