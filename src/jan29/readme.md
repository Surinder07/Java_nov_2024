### Continuous Integration 
--> developers merge code into the shared repository 
-- > checks for unit test cases 

                            Project X    Merging the code into single repository

#  Continuous Deployment 
 Continous delivery  - code is 100% ready to be released 
continous deployment - code released to production


Sonar Qube - tool for checking the code quality 

Pipeline - > Automate the release of code, 
Write code -- Maven   --> Junit Test ----> sonar qube  ---> Docker ---> QA env 
                                                               Staging env 
                                                               Production Env

Maven[Build tool- to convert the code into Jar file]

Jenkins is used to automate this process. 


IntelliJ --- .exe               .dmg 


java archieve 
.jar ------> compiled code into 1 package 




## Maven ?  Tool   / Gradle 
Build tool 

Build - Process of converting Java source code into executable bytcode 
that your Java virtual machine(JVM) can run. 


compile code 
check for any issues 
testing 
package the code at the end 



=======> .jar 


# it helps to manage dependencies 

Dependency means on which your code depends to execute. 

3rd party library -----eg. Lombok 
LOMBOK - helps to remove boiler plate code. 


Maven goals 
1. clean 
2. compile 
3. test 
4. install 
5. package
